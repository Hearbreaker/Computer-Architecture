Project 2 Dynamic Branch Prediction

The objective of this project is to investigate the performance of different dynamic branch
prediction schemes. 

Use the Championship Branch Prediction (CBP-4) simulator to determine the number of mispredictions
per thousand instructions (MPKI) of the following predictors:
• a 2-bit saturating counter predictor 
• a two-level predictor that uses 2-bit saturating counters 
• an open-ended predictor
Simulate all three predictors on the following benchmarks: astar, bwaves, bzip2, gcc, gromacs,
hmmer, mcf, and soplex.
