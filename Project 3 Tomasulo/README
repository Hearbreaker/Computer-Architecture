The objective of this project is to investigate the impact of Tomasulo’s dynamic scheduling
algorithm on performance. 

Problem Statement
In this project, I used the SimpleScalar simulator to measure the total number of cycles
it would take to run a benchmark with dynamic scheduling. Specifically, you are asked to simulate
an in-order dispatch & dynamic scheduling Tomasulo’s algorithm with no speculation.
